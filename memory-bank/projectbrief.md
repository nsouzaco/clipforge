# Project Brief

## Project Overview
ClipForge is a lightweight, native desktop video editor built with Tauri and React. It enables creators to record, edit, and export professional videos without the complexity of traditional editing software.

## Timeline
- **MVP Deadline:** Tuesday, October 28, 2025, 10:59 PM CT
- **Final Deadline:** Wednesday, October 29, 2025, 10:59 PM CT
- **Total Duration:** 72 hours (October 27-29, 2025)

## Core Objectives
1. Build a functional desktop video editor that can import, edit, and export videos
2. Implement screen and webcam recording capabilities
3. Create an intuitive timeline interface for video editing
4. Achieve near-native performance with modern web-based UI

## Success Criteria

### MVP Gate (Critical)
- ✅ Desktop app launches successfully
- ✅ Import video files (MP4/MOV) via drag-and-drop or file picker
- ✅ Timeline displays imported clips visually
- ✅ Video preview player with playback controls
- ✅ Trim functionality (set in/out points)
- ✅ Export single clip to MP4
- ✅ Native app build (not dev mode)

### Final Submission (Nice-to-Have)
- All core features implemented and tested
- Stable performance with 10+ clips
- Complete recording capabilities
- Professional export pipeline

## Key Constraints
- Must use Tauri + React tech stack
- Must be a desktop application (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Must integrate with FFmpeg for media processing
- All critical MVP features must be functional by Day 2
- Must package as native app for submission

## Project Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Basic video import, editing, and export
- Screen recording (single screen/window)
- Webcam recording
- Picture-in-Picture recording
- Timeline-based editing (trim, split, arrange)
- Single-clip and multi-clip export
- Native desktop performance

### Out of Scope (v1)
- Cloud collaboration
- Advanced color grading
- Motion graphics / keyframe animation
- Multi-cam editing
- Proxy workflows for 4K footage
- Plugin system
- Mobile companion app
