# Active Context

## Current Status
**Project Phase:** Day 1 Foundation Complete → MVP Implementation  
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Active Work:** Timeline video playback and synchronization implemented

## Current Focus
1. ✅ Project structure and dependencies set up
2. ✅ Basic UI components implemented
3. ✅ File import system (drag-and-drop + picker)
4. ✅ Video preview player with controls
5. ✅ Timeline canvas rendering
6. ✅ Video playback with multiple fallback approaches
7. ✅ Video thumbnail generation
8. 🔄 Next: FFmpeg integration for actual video operations

## Recent Decisions
- ✅ Using Tauri + React with TypeScript
- ✅ State management: Zustand (working well)
- ✅ Timeline rendering: HTML5 Canvas (smooth 60fps)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS plugin
- ✅ Media processing: FFmpeg via Rust subprocess calls (ready to implement)

## Completed Today
1. ✅ Tauri project initialization
2. ✅ TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Zustand setup
3. ✅ Rust backend structure (video.rs, recording.rs modules)
4. ✅ React component structure (TopBar, MediaLibrary, VideoPreview, Timeline)
5. ✅ File import with drag-and-drop
6. ✅ Video preview player (play/pause, scrubber, volume, speed)
7. ✅ Timeline canvas rendering (playhead, time ruler, clip display)
8. ✅ Zustand store for state management
9. ✅ Video playback with multiple fallback approaches (convertFileSrc, blob URLs)
10. ✅ Video thumbnail generation using FFmpeg
11. ✅ Remove video functionality from timeline
12. ✅ Timeline video playback synchronization
13. ✅ Multi-clip timeline support with automatic clip switching
14. ✅ Timeline play/pause controls connected to video player
15. ✅ Playhead synchronization between timeline and video player

## Next Steps (MVP Priority)

### High Priority - Core MVP
1. **FFmpeg Integration (Rust)**
   - Implement actual video metadata extraction
   - Test with ffprobe command
   - Add proper error handling
   
2. **Clip Management**
   - Add clips from media library to timeline
   - Implement clip dragging/reordering
   - Trim functionality (adjust in/out points)
   - Delete clips

3. **Export System**
   - Build FFmpeg export command
   - Single clip export
   - Progress tracking
   - Error handling

4. **Testing & Polish**
   - Test import → preview → timeline flow
   - Fix any bugs
   - Optimize performance

### Medium Priority
- Native app build (.app, .exe, .AppImage)
- Documentation
- Demo video preparation

## Active Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- ✅ FFmpeg via subprocess (not Rust bindings) - simpler for MVP
- ✅ State persistence: In-memory for now (localStorage later)
- ✅ Export format: MP4 H.264 (confirmed)
- 🔄 Thumbnail generation: Will use FFmpeg frame extraction

### Implementation Notes
- File import is working but needs actual FFmpeg metadata
- Video preview now uses `convertFileSrc` API for proper file handling
- Timeline canvas rendering is smooth
- Need to test drag-and-drop from MediaLibrary to Timeline

### Known Issues to Address
- ✅ Video playback fixed - now using multiple fallback approaches including blob URLs
- ✅ Video thumbnails implemented using FFmpeg
- ✅ Remove video functionality added
- ✅ Tauri capabilities updated to allow temp directory access
- ✅ Video loading timeout and error handling improved
- ✅ Thumbnail loading fixed - using blob URLs instead of convertFileSrc
- ✅ Console log spam removed - performance issues resolved
- Video import metadata is stubbed (needs FFmpeg probe)
- Export functionality not implemented yet
- No actual video file operations yet

## Timeline Management
- **Day 1 (Today):** ✅ Foundation complete
- **Day 2 (Tomorrow):** MVP submission by 10:59 PM CT
  - Priority: Import → Edit → Export working end-to-end
- **Day 3:** Polish and additional features

## Risk Mitigation Status
- ✅ Canvas rendering working well (60fps capable)
- 🔄 FFmpeg integration next critical step
- ⚠️ Need to test with real video files
- ⚠️ Export pipeline needs careful testing

## Blockers
- ✅ **FIXED**: Video playback issue - implemented multiple fallback approaches
- ✅ **FIXED**: Video thumbnails - implemented FFmpeg-based thumbnail generation
- ✅ **FIXED**: Remove video functionality - added delete button and keyboard shortcuts
- Ready to proceed with FFmpeg integration

## Notes
- Tailwind CSS v4 configuration fixed (using @tailwindcss/postcss)
- TypeScript compilation clean (no errors)
- Rust compilation clean (only unused function warnings)
- UI layout looks good and functional
- State management working smoothly with Zustand
